# Event Game Toolkit

**Version 1.0.0** | Unity 6+

An educational Unity toolkit designed for the "Animation and Interactivity" class. Provides modular, no-code components using UnityEvents to create interactive experiences without writing code.

## üìö Overview

The Event Game Toolkit is built around an **event-driven architecture** where students visually connect components in the Unity Inspector using UnityEvents. This enables complex interactive behaviors without requiring programming knowledge.

### Core Philosophy

- **Input Components** (Event Sources) - Detect events like key presses, collisions, triggers
- **Action Components** (Event Targets) - Perform actions when triggered (spawn, display, animate)
- **UnityEvents** - Visual connections in the Inspector that wire behaviors together

### What's Included

- **69 C# scripts** across 8 categories
- **46 educational components** (100% XML-documented)
- **11 example scene generators** (Tools > Examples menu)
- **Comprehensive documentation** system
- **DOTween integration** for professional animations

## üéì Educational Use

### Learning Outcomes

Students will understand:
- Event-driven programming concepts
- Component-based architecture
- Physics and animation principles
- Systems thinking for interactive design

### No-Code Approach

Students create complex interactions by:
1. Adding components to GameObjects
2. Configuring settings in the Inspector
3. Connecting UnityEvents visually
4. Testing and iterating

**Example Flow:**
```
InputTriggerZone (detects player)
  ‚Üí onTriggerEnterEvent
    ‚Üí ActionSpawnObject.SpawnSinglePrefab() (spawns enemy)
```
