## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes - For Overwhelmed Students!)

**Feeling overwhelmed by all the details below? Don't worry! Here's the absolute minimum to get a working character moving around.** You can always come back and add fancy features like dodge rolls, moving platforms, and animations later. Let's start simple:

### Your First Working Character (3 Easy Steps)

**Step 1: Add the Component**
1. Create an empty GameObject in your scene (Right-click in Hierarchy ‚Üí Create Empty)
2. Name it "Player" and position it at (0, 1, 0) - just above the ground
3. In the Inspector, click **Add Component** and search for "CharacterControllerCC"
4. Unity automatically adds a CharacterController component for you ‚ú®

**Step 2: Connect the Input**
1. With Player still selected, click **Add Component** again
2. Search for "PlayerInput" and add it
3. In the PlayerInput component:
   - Set **Actions** to `InputSystem_Actions` (find it in your Assets folder)
   - Set **Default Map** to "Player"
   - Set **Behavior** to "Send Messages"

**Step 3: Set the Ground Layer**
1. In the CharacterControllerCC component (scroll down if needed)
2. Find **Ground Layer** under "Jump Settings"
3. Click the dropdown and check the layer your ground uses (probably "Default" or "Ground")

**That's it! Press Play and use WASD to move, Space to jump!** üéâ

### It's Not Working? Try These:
- ‚úÖ Make sure you have a ground object (like a plane or cube) under your character
- ‚úÖ Make sure your Main Camera is in the scene and tagged "MainCamera"
- ‚úÖ Check that the ground has a Collider component (not a trigger)

### What to Do Next (When You're Ready):
- üìñ **Want animations?** ‚Üí See "Step 4: Setup Character Mesh/Model" below
- üéÆ **Want dodge rolls?** ‚Üí See "Dodge Settings" in the Parameter Reference
- üõ§Ô∏è **Want moving platforms?** ‚Üí See "Scenario 2: Platformer with Moving Platforms"
- üé® **Want to customize movement feel?** ‚Üí See "Movement Settings" (change Move Speed, Jump Height, etc.)

**Remember:** You don't need to understand everything at once! Start with WASD movement, then add one feature at a time when you're comfortable. The full documentation below is here when you need it - not all at once. You've got this! üí™

## Required Components

### Automatically Added Components
When you add CharacterControllerCC to a GameObject, Unity will automatically add:
- **CharacterController** - Required for kinematic movement (tagged with `[RequireComponent]`)

### Components You Must Add
1. **PlayerInput** - For Unity Input System integration
2. **Animator** (optional) - If using animations
3. **Capsule Mesh or Character Model** (optional) - Visual representation

---

## Complete Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create Character GameObject

1. Create an empty GameObject in your scene
2. Name it "Player" or "Character"
3. Position it above the ground (e.g., Y = 1)
4. Add the **CharacterControllerCC** component
   - This automatically adds **CharacterController**

### Step 2: Configure CharacterController Component

The script auto-configures this, but verify these settings:

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Slope Limit** | 45¬∞ | Auto-set from `maxSlopeAngle` |
| **Skin Width** | 0.08 | Auto-set if < 0.01 |
| **Center** | (0, 1, 0) | Center of capsule |
| **Radius** | 0.5 | Capsule radius |
| **Height** | 2.0 | Capsule height |

### Step 3: Setup Input System

1. Add **PlayerInput** component to the same GameObject
2. Configure PlayerInput:
   - **Actions**: Select `InputSystem_Actions` asset
   - **Default Map**: "Player"
   - **Behavior**: "Invoke Unity Events" or "Send Messages"
3. Required Input Actions in your InputActionAsset:
   - **Move** (Vector2) - WASD or left stick
   - **Jump** (Button) - Space or gamepad button
   - **Dodge** (Button) - Left Shift or gamepad button

**Input Callbacks:**
The script listens for these Input System callbacks:
- `OnMove(InputValue value)` - Movement input
- `OnJump(InputValue value)` - Jump input
- `OnDodge(InputValue value)` - Dodge input

### Step 4: Setup Character Mesh/Model (Optional)

If using a 3D character model with animations:

1. Create a child GameObject named "CharacterMesh"
2. Add your character model as a child of this GameObject
3. Add **Animator** component to the model GameObject
4. In CharacterControllerCC Inspector:
   - Assign **Character Mesh** ‚Üí the GameObject with your model
   - Assign **Character Animator** ‚Üí the Animator component
5. Setup Animator Controller with these parameters:

| Parameter Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Float | Horizontal movement speed (0 = idle, 8 = running) |
| **Grounded** | Bool | True when character is on the ground |
| **VerticalVelocity** | Float | Upward/downward velocity (positive = rising, negative = falling) |
| **IsDodging** | Bool | True during dodge animation |
| **IsWalking** | Bool | True when moving on ground (combines Speed > 0.1 && Grounded) |

**Example Animator State Setup:**
```
Idle (default)
‚îú‚îÄ Transition to Walk (Condition: IsWalking == true)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Has Exit Time: ‚ùå
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Transition Duration: 0.1s
‚îÇ
Walk
‚îú‚îÄ Transition to Idle (Condition: IsWalking == false)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Has Exit Time: ‚ùå
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Transition Duration: 0.1s
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Transition to Jump (Condition: Grounded == false, VerticalVelocity > 0.1)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Has Exit Time: ‚ùå
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Transition Duration: 0.0s
‚îÇ
Jump
‚îú‚îÄ Transition to Fall (Condition: VerticalVelocity < -0.1)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Has Exit Time: ‚ùå
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Transition Duration: 0.1s
‚îÇ
Fall
‚îú‚îÄ Transition to Land (Condition: Grounded == true)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Has Exit Time: ‚ùå
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Transition Duration: 0.1s
‚îÇ
Dodge
‚îú‚îÄ Transition to Idle (Condition: IsDodging == false)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Has Exit Time: ‚úÖ (Exit Time: 0.9)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Transition Duration: 0.15s
```

### Step 5: Setup Layers

Create these layers in your project (Edit > Project Settings > Tags and Layers):

1. **Ground** - For walkable surfaces
2. **MovingPlatform** (optional) - For moving platform detection

In CharacterControllerCC Inspector:
- **Ground Layer**: Select "Ground" layer
- **Platform Layer**: Select "MovingPlatform" layer (if using Layer or Both detection mode)

### Step 6: Tag Moving Platforms (If Using Tag Detection)

If using `PlatformDetectionMode.Tag` or `PlatformDetectionMode.Both`:

1. Select your moving platform GameObject
2. Set Tag to "movingPlatform" (or customize in CharacterControllerCC's **Platform Tag** field)

## Hierarchy Structure

### Recommended Hierarchy

```
Player (CharacterControllerCC, CharacterController, PlayerInput)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CharacterMesh (optional - for visual model)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YourCharacterModel (MeshRenderer, Animator)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Armature/Skeleton
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mesh
```

### Camera Setup

For camera-relative movement to work, ensure you have a **Main Camera** in your scene:
- Camera tagged as "MainCamera"
- Positioned to view the character (e.g., third-person view)

**Cinemachine Setup (Recommended):**
```
CM vcam1 (CinemachineVirtualCamera)
‚îú‚îÄ Follow: Player (Transform)
‚îú‚îÄ Look At: Player (Transform)
‚îî‚îÄ Body: 3rd Person Follow
```

## Parameter Reference

### Movement Settings

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Move Speed** | float | 8 | Base movement speed in m/s when walking |
| **Max Velocity** | float | 8 | Maximum horizontal speed (prevents infinite acceleration) |
| **Speed Change Rate** | float | 10 | How fast the character accelerates and decelerates (higher = snappier) |
| **Air Control Factor** | float | 0.5 | Movement control while in air (0.5 = 50% of ground speed) |

**Usage Tips:**
- `Move Speed` = Comfortable walking speed (5-8 for realistic, 10-15 for arcade)
- `Speed Change Rate` = 10-15 for responsive, 5-8 for heavy/realistic
- `Air Control Factor` = 0.3-0.5 for realistic, 0.8-1.0 for arcade platformers

---

### Jump Settings

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Jump Height** | float | 1.2 | Maximum jump height in meters (uses physics formula) |
| **Jump Timeout** | float | 0.5 | Cooldown between jumps to prevent spam (seconds) |
| **Ground Check Distance** | float | 0.1 | How far down to check for ground (should be small) |
| **Ground Layer** | LayerMask | Default | Which layers count as ground |

**Height Formula:**
Jump velocity is calculated using `v = ‚àö(height √ó -2 √ó gravity)`, making jump height intuitive:
- `1.0` = Jump 1 meter high
- `1.5` = Jump 1.5 meters high
- `2.0` = Jump 2 meters high

**Usage Tips:**
- Set `Jump Height` to match level design (0.8-1.2 for realistic, 2-4 for platformers)
- `Jump Timeout` = 0.5 prevents spam jumping, 0.0 allows instant consecutive jumps
- `Ground Check Distance` should be small (0.1-0.2), just enough to detect ground

---

### Dodge Settings

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Dodge Distance** | float | 5 | How far the character travels during dodge (meters) |
| **Dodge Speed** | float | 20 | How fast the dodge movement is (m/s) |
| **Dodge Cooldown** | float | 1 | Time before dodge can be used again (seconds) |
| **Allow Air Dodge** | bool | false | Can the character dodge while airborne? |

**Dodge Mechanics:**
- Dodge direction = movement input direction (or facing if no input)
- Blocked on steep slopes to prevent climbing walls
- Horizontal velocity is overridden during dodge, vertical velocity preserved

**Usage Tips:**
- Combat game: `Dodge Distance = 3-5`, `Cooldown = 0.8-1.2`, `Allow Air Dodge = false`
- Platformer: `Dodge Distance = 5-8`, `Cooldown = 0.5`, `Allow Air Dodge = true`

---

### Character Settings

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Rotation Smooth Time** | float | 0.12 | How quickly character turns to face movement direction (seconds) |
| **Controller** | CharacterController | Auto | Reference to CharacterController component (auto-assigned) |

**Rotation Behavior:**
- Uses `SmoothDampAngle` for natural, smooth rotation
- Only rotates during active input (prevents spinning)
- `0.05` = Very snappy rotation
- `0.12` = Unity standard (recommended)
- `0.25` = Slow, heavy rotation

---

### Gravity Settings

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Gravity** | float | -20 | Downward acceleration force (negative = down) |
| **Terminal Velocity** | float | -50 | Maximum falling speed (prevents infinite fall acceleration) |
| **Ground Stick Force** | float | -1.5 | Small downward force when grounded (keeps character stuck to ground) |

**Gravity Explanation:**
- Applied every `FixedUpdate` when not grounded: `velocity.y += gravity * Time.fixedDeltaTime`
- Real-world gravity ‚âà -9.8 m/s¬≤, games often use -15 to -25 for better feel
- `Ground Stick Force` ensures character doesn't "hop" when walking downhill

**Usage Tips:**
- Realistic: `Gravity = -15`, `Terminal Velocity = -40`
- Standard: `Gravity = -20`, `Terminal Velocity = -50` (default)
- Floaty/Moon: `Gravity = -8`, `Terminal Velocity = -20`

---

### Slope Settings

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Max Slope Angle** | float | 45 | Maximum walkable slope in degrees (steeper = slide) |
| **Slope Check Distance** | float | 1 | How far ahead to check for slopes (meters) |
| **Slope Slide Speed** | float | 5 | How fast character slides down steep slopes (m/s) |

**Slope System:**
- Detects slope angle via SphereCast surface normal
- Blocks upward movement on slopes > `Max Slope Angle`
- Automatically slides down steep slopes with `Slope Slide Speed`
- Fires `onSteepSlope` event when encountering unclimbable slope

**Usage Tips:**
- Realistic game: `Max Slope Angle = 35-45¬∞`
- Arcade platformer: `Max Slope Angle = 50-60¬∞`
- Set `Slope Slide Speed` to 5-8 for gradual slide, 10-15 for fast slide

---

### Platform Settings

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Platform Detection Mode** | Enum | Tag | How to detect moving platforms (Tag, Layer, or Both) |
| **Platform Layer** | LayerMask | None | Which layer moving platforms are on (used for Layer/Both modes) |
| **Platform Tag** | string | "movingPlatform" | Tag name for moving platforms (used for Tag/Both modes) |
| **Apply Vertical Movement** | bool | true | Should character move vertically with platform (elevators)? |

**Detection Modes:**

| Mode | Raycast Layer | Tag Check | Use Case |
|------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Tag** | Ground Layer | ‚úÖ Required | Easiest for students - just tag platforms |
| **Layer** | Platform Layer | ‚ùå Ignored | Separate layer for organization |
| **Both** | Platform Layer | ‚úÖ Required | Most restrictive - requires both tag AND layer |

**How It Works:**
1. Raycasts downward to detect platform beneath character
2. Tracks platform position/rotation each frame
3. Calculates delta movement since last frame
4. Applies platform movement to character via `controller.Move()`

**Usage Tips:**
- **Tag Mode** (Recommended for students): Set platforms to "movingPlatform" tag, use Ground layer
- **Layer Mode**: Create separate "MovingPlatform" layer, no tagging required
- Disable `Apply Vertical Movement` for horizontal-only platforms (no elevator effect)

---

### Animation

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Character Animator** | Animator | null | Reference to Animator component (for animation control) |
| **Character Mesh** | Transform | null | Reference to character model root (script auto-finds Animator here) |

**Auto-Assignment:**
If you assign `Character Mesh` but leave `Character Animator` empty, the script will automatically search for an Animator component on the mesh's children.

---

### UnityEvents (Output Events)

All UnityEvents can be wired in the Inspector for no-code interactions.

| Event Name | When It Fires |
|------------|---------------|
| **onGrounded** | Every frame while character is touching the ground |
| **onJump** | When jump is initiated (upward velocity applied) |
| **onLanding** | When character lands on ground after being airborne |
| **onStartMoving** | When character begins horizontal movement |
| **onStopMoving** | When character stops moving horizontally |
| **onSteepSlope** | When character encounters slope > `Max Slope Angle` |
| **onDodge** | When dodge movement begins |
| **onDodgeCooldownReady** | When dodge cooldown finishes and dodge is ready again |

**Event Usage Examples:**

```
onJump ‚Üí Play jump sound effect
onLanding ‚Üí Spawn dust particle effect
onDodge ‚Üí Play dodge animation, trigger i-frames
onSteepSlope ‚Üí Display "Too steep!" UI message
onStartMoving ‚Üí Start footstep audio loop
onStopMoving ‚Üí Stop footstep audio loop
```

4. Test with different slope angles:
   - 0-45¬∞ = Walkable
   - 46-90¬∞ = Character slides down

**Result:** Natural slope-based movement restrictions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Character Won't Move
**Symptoms:** Input works but character doesn't respond
**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Check PlayerInput component is added and configured
- ‚úÖ Verify InputActions asset is assigned
- ‚úÖ Ensure `Move` action exists and is mapped to WASD/stick
- ‚úÖ Check Main Camera exists and is tagged "MainCamera"
- ‚úÖ Verify `Move Speed` > 0

### Character Doesn't Jump
**Symptoms:** Jump input fires but character stays grounded
**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Check `Ground Layer` matches your ground objects' layer
- ‚úÖ Ensure `Jump Height` > 0 and `Gravity` < 0 (negative)
- ‚úÖ Verify ground objects have colliders
- ‚úÖ Check `Jump Timeout` isn't blocking spam jumps

### Character Falls Through Ground
**Symptoms:** Character phases through floor
**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Ensure ground has Collider component
- ‚úÖ Verify `Ground Layer` includes ground objects' layer
- ‚úÖ Check CharacterController `Skin Width` isn't too large (use 0.08)
- ‚úÖ Ground colliders must not be triggers

### Character Doesn't Stick to Moving Platforms
**Symptoms:** Platform slides out from under character
**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Check `Platform Detection Mode` matches your setup:
  - **Tag mode**: Platform must have correct tag
  - **Layer mode**: Platform must be on correct layer
  - **Both mode**: Platform needs both tag AND layer
- ‚úÖ Verify platform raycast hits the platform (check gizmo visualization)
- ‚úÖ Ensure platform is on `Ground Layer` if using Tag mode
- ‚úÖ Check platform has collider (not trigger)

### Character Can Climb Steep Walls
**Symptoms:** Character walks up 80¬∞ walls
**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Verify `Max Slope Angle` is set correctly (default 45¬∞)
- ‚úÖ Ensure wall objects are on `Ground Layer`
- ‚úÖ Check wall colliders are properly configured
- ‚úÖ Look at blue slope normal gizmo - should point away from wall

### Animator Parameters Not Working
**Symptoms:** "Parameter does not exist" errors
**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Create these parameters in Animator Controller:
  - `Speed` (Float)
  - `Grounded` (Bool)
  - `VerticalVelocity` (Float)
  - `IsDodging` (Bool)
  - `IsWalking` (Bool)
- ‚úÖ Parameter names are case-sensitive (must match exactly)
- ‚úÖ Script has safety checks - missing parameters won't cause crashes

### Character Spins Randomly
**Symptoms:** Character rotates when standing still
**Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ This was fixed in latest version - rotation only occurs during active input
- ‚úÖ Check input deadzone in InputActions (set to 0.2 for stick drift)
- ‚úÖ Verify `Rotation Smooth Time` is reasonable (0.05-0.3)

---

## Best Practices

### Performance
- ‚úÖ Use StringToHash for animator parameters (automatic in script)
- ‚úÖ Ground checking uses SphereCast + CharacterController.isGrounded (efficient hybrid)
- ‚úÖ Platform detection only raycasts when needed
- ‚úÖ Gizmos only render when GameObject is selected

### Level Design
- üéØ Design slopes within `Max Slope Angle` for walkable areas
- üéØ Use steeper slopes for visual-only terrain (character will slide)
- üéØ Place moving platforms on consistent layer/tag for easy detection
- üéØ Test jump height early to ensure level is navigable

### Animation
- üé® Use blend trees for movement (Idle ‚Üí Walk ‚Üí Run based on `Speed`)
- üé® Set transition "Has Exit Time" based on animation type:
  - Movement transitions: ‚ùå (instant response)
  - Attack/dodge: ‚úÖ (let animation complete)
- üé® Use `VerticalVelocity` to differentiate jump (positive) from fall (negative)

### Events
- üì¢ Use `onGrounded` sparingly (fires every frame) - prefer `onLanding` for one-time events
- üì¢ Wire `onDodge` to disable damage collision for dodge i-frames
- üì¢ Use `onSteepSlope` to guide players away from unclimbable areas

## Technical Notes

### Physics Update Timing
- Movement calculations occur in `FixedUpdate` for physics consistency
- Visual updates (rotation, animation) occur in `Update` for smooth rendering
- Platform movement uses `FixedUpdate` time steps for accurate delta tracking

### Grounded Detection Algorithm
1. If `velocity.y > 0.1`, force not grounded (prevents mid-jump grounding)
2. Perform SphereCast downward from capsule bottom
3. Check `CharacterController.isGrounded` as backup
4. Combine both checks for reliability
5. Extract surface normal from SphereCast hit for slope calculation

### Moving Platform System
- Uses **non-parenting approach** - character not parented to platform
- Tracks platform position/rotation delta each frame
- Applies delta movement via `controller.Move()` in platform's local space
- Handles both translation and rotation correctly
- 2-frame stabilization delay after landing to prevent jitter

### Slope Sliding Physics
- Calculates slide direction: `Vector3.ProjectOnPlane(Vector3.down, slopeNormal)`
- Overrides horizontal velocity during slide
- Blocks upward movement input on steep slopes
- Preserves slope normal from SphereCast for accurate physics
